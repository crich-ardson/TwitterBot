# **CRTutBot**

Authored by: Cameron Richardson

​	This project is a small set of example code to experiment with automated Twitter favoriting and retweeting using the [Tweepy API](https://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/3.7.0/). For my own experimentation, I sent my bot through Twitter searching for the following hashtags : #art, #fanart, #blackart,  and #blackartist. I occasionally limited my searching radius to my immediate location, an 1000km radius around Boston, MA. In addition, I included code to store Tweet ids with the long term goal of tracking tweet locations or coordinates to map the proximity between content creators on the platform.

​	To start experimenting with the bot, you must first register your Twitter account for [Twitter for Developers](https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new). Grab the four critical keys, paste them into the CRTutBot_Access.py file, and then hack away. Unfortunately, my bot design will run into the Twitter rate limit from frequent use. I am actively working on rectifying the issue through design or usage changes.

For other information and tutorials on Twitter Bots, look towards [Botwiki](https://botwiki.org/bots/) for numerous examples in the field.
